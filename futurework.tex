\label{sec:future}

\subsection{New Techniques}
\label{sec:future-new}
% new techniques for landslide:
% - hybrid with data-race/lockset/static-analysis; shm choices
% - parallelism
% - ICB as in chess
% - hybrid with symbolic execution

\subsection{Education}
\label{sec:future-education}
% teaching tool, study thinking patterns
% 410 stuff

\subsection{Production Kernels}
\label{sec:future-linux}
% linux, device drivers
% embedded microcontroller operating systems, simulated

\subsection{Performance}
\label{sec:future-perf}
% VM instead of simics
% - how to interpose? single-step, or unmap heap, and/or annotate (for hooks) with hypercalls
% - how to time travel? instead of time travel, snapshot once and replay

\subsection{Long-Running Testing Approaches}
\label{sec:future-shaping}
% - garth's shaping

\subsection{Theoretical Oddities}
\label{sec:future-theory}
% theory things to study:
% - study the implications of backwards vs forward exploration
% - nadim's backtrack depth
