% Still other efforts present testing techniques orthogonal to systematic exploration, which could augment its effectiveness if combined in one tool.

\subsection{Interface Improvements}
\label{sec:future-interface}
% make user able to replay the choices
% better decision trace representation
% in general, feedback from the tests

\subsection{New Techniques}
\label{sec:future-new}
% new techniques for landslide:
% - hybrid with data-race/lockset/static-analysis; automated shm choices
% - parallelism
% - ICB as in chess
% - hybrid with symbolic execution
% - choice trace minimization

symbolic execution\cite{klee,dawson}

\subsection{Education}
\label{sec:future-education}
% teaching tool, study thinking patterns
% 410 stuff

\subsection{Production Kernels}
\label{sec:future-linux}
% linux, device drivers
% embedded microcontroller operating systems, simulated

\subsection{Performance}
\label{sec:future-perf}
% VM instead of simics
% - how to interpose? single-step, or unmap heap, and/or annotate (for hooks) with hypercalls
% - how to time travel? instead of time travel, snapshot once and replay

\subsection{Long-Running Testing Approaches}
\label{sec:future-shaping}
% - garth's shaping

\subsection{Theoretical Oddities}
\label{sec:future-theory}
% theory things to study:
\subsubsection{``Backwards'' Exploration}
\label{sec:future-backwards}
% - study the implications of backwards vs forward exploration
\subsubsection{Exploration Tree Structure}
% - nadim's backtrack depth
